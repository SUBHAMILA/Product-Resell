In most of the companies, forecasting drives the fundamental business planning, procurement and production activities. Any errors in the forecasts will ripple down throughout the supply chain or any business context for that matter. So, it’s important to get the forecasts accurate in order to save on costs and is critical to success. 

Customer segmentation plays an important role in business. Not all the customers are organization’s interest. Every customer cannot be treated in the same way with the same content and same importance. Customers who use the products have different needs. Many different segmentations are possible according to the objective of the project. If the goal is to increase the retention rate, segmentation based on churn probability can be done. But there are very common and useful segmentation methods as well. Organization invests in customers (acquisition costs, promotions, discounts, etc.,) to generate revenue and be profitable. Naturally, these actions make some customers super valuable in terms of lifetime value but there are always some customers who pull down the profitability. The aim is to identify these behavior patterns, segment customers and act accordingly.

Objective:

The objective of the project is to predict the potential next resell that would happen in the future for a customer site and specific products using the past sales data which could be used by the sales representative.

Why is the product resell important? 

Estimating the next resell date will help the sales representative not to miss any sales.
Inventory can be equipped in advance.
Trends of the sales can boost the salesat the right time to the right person with profitability.
Increasing the performance of the sales representative.

	
When time series forecasting was used for prediction, it did predict the next resell, but the problem is that it does not consider the frequency nor the customers who has a pattern or seasonality in buying, though it considers the customers who buys recently. On using Lifetimes Package,this model focuses exclusively on how customers make repeat purchases over their lifetime. Avantage of this method over others is that, it considers frequency and recent purchases which plays an important role in predicting the next resell. So, this method is considered for predicting the next resell.

Terms used in Lifetimes Package
1.	‘Frequency’ represents the number of repeats purchases the customer has made. This means that it’s one less than the total number of purchases.
2.	‘T’ represents the age of the customer in whatever time units chosen (daily, weekly, monthly, etc). This is equal to the duration between a customer’s first purchase and the end of the period under study.
3.	‘Recency’ represents the age of the customer when they made their most recent purchases. This is equal to the duration between a customer’s first purchase and their latest purchase.The probability derived from this method considers frequency, recent visit, observation period and customer’s lifetime.

Finally, we get the probability that a customer will purachse that particular material in a specified time period which can be used by the sales representative to improve his performance thus improving the profit of the organization.
